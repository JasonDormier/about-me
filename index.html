        Hello, my name is Jason Dormier. I’m so happy to have you here. I suppose you would like to know a little about
        me. I’m what you might be called a jack of all trades. I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I
        want to be when I grow up. I have worked as a game designer at Mircosoft and the game FORZA 6. I was a freelance
        concept artist for the games and entertainment industry. I have worked in customer service and most recently as
        a project manager for a small construction company. I have worked with a wide breadth of people and have always
        loved learning new things from the diverse range of people I meet. My hope is to return to the tech industry and
        work for a small start-up company where I can utilize my Art, Design, and newly acquired Software Development
        skills, and finally make big boy $$$.
      </p>
